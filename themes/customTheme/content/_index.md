Hi! I'm Maks, a teen programmer.
I love computers, bicycles and music.


Some of my skills:
- I develop apps with **Dart** and **Flutter**. My Sudoku app for Android that uses Flutter: https://github.com/dudozermaks/sudoku
- I do competitive programming in **Rust**
- I know **Linux** well. I have been using Linux (mainly Arch) on my PC for 2â€“3 years
- I can build simple websites using **Hugo**
- I love embedded programming, especially with **Raspberry Pi Pico** and **ESP32**

My languages tool set is: 
- **Dart (Flutter)** - if something needs GUI
- **Rust** - mostly for performance-critical parts of applications
- **Python** - for CLI tools and research
- **GDScript (Godot Game Engine)** - for games

Languages that I'm familiar with:
- C++ (good knowledge, switched to Rust)
- Bash (mostly use Python instead of Bash)
- HTML/CSS/JS
